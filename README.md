# bulldozer-price-prediction
This project solves a machine learning regression problem. We will be using a Kaggle Dataset from a competition, to predict bulldozer prices. It is a more advanced project, but still for beginners. I wrote it together in one of my Machine Learning courses it took to improve my skills in 2023-2024

## Important Information
* Because the data folder was to big, you need to donwload the Dataset from kaggle your own and than put it into a folder called data. The rest should work.

### Notebook
* In this Notebook we have coded everything. Also we described the code really good and at the end we have one little research exercise and one Challange to take.

### Environment file
* In this file you can activate the environment.

### Something about
* This project is a time series project - we are working with Time data
* Also it is structured data
* It was original used for a Kaggle Competition, with the goal to get the best RMSLE (Root Mean Squared logarithm error) - the lower the better
* I wrote this project together with an online course I tooked, at the beginning of the Notebook I refered to the End-To-End workflow
