# bulldozer-price-prediction
This project solves a machine learning regression problem. We will be using a Kaggle Dataset from a competition, to predict bulldozer prices. It is a more advanced project, but still for beginners. I wrote it together in one of my Machine Learning courses it took to improve my skills in 2023-2024
